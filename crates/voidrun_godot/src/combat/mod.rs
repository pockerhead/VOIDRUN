//! Combat domain â€” unified melee, AI decision-making, and ranged combat.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! This domain combines three previously separate systems:
//! - **melee**: Melee attack execution (animations, hitboxes, parry)
//! - **ai_melee**: AI combat decision-making (unified attack/parry decisions)
//! - **ranged**: Ranged combat (targeting, firing, projectile physics)
//!
//! # Design Rationale
//!
//! These were combined because they share:
//! - Common combat state (WeaponStats, AttackPhase)
//! - Interrelated mechanics (melee parry vs ranged fire timing)
//! - Same tactical layer responsibilities (Godot validation + execution)
//!
//! # Submodules
//!
//! - `melee/`: Melee attack execution (Godot tactical layer)
//! - `ai_melee/`: AI unified combat decision system
//! - `ranged/`: Ranged weapon targeting, firing, projectile physics
